Please see the two files requested as part of the submission:

1) The RMD file with the r code base and output
2) The HTML file as generated via knitR and uploaded to GH. I will continue trying to get this to work via gh-pages, but in the meantime, here is the rPubs link to the html in case you don't mind grading off of that: http://rpubs.com/varunpoddar/predictive-model-fitness
